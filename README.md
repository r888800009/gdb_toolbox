# gdb_toolbox
gdb toolbox is a collection of gdb scripts for binary analysis

- `fmtstr_offset`: auto find offset for format string attack (TODO)

## dependencies
not included but future scripts may need them
- `angr`, `z3`, `pwntools`, `pwnlib`

## Development
this project should only contain gdb plugins, other tools should be in other repos,
like [r888800009/CTF-tool](https://github.com/r888800009/CTF-tool)
